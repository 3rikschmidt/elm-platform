# Upgrading to 0.16


## Update elm-package.json

First thing you want to do is update your `elm-package.json` file. The fields that need work are `elm-version` and `dependencies`.

Here is a working `elm-version`:

```json
{
    "elm-version": "0.16.0 <= v < 0.17.0"
}
```

Here are the latest bounds for a bunch of `dependencies`.

```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "elm-lang/core": "3.0.0 <= v < 4.0.0",
        "evancz/elm-effects": "2.0.1 <= v < 3.0.0",
        "evancz/elm-html": "4.0.2 <= v < 5.0.0",
        "evancz/elm-http": "3.0.0 <= v < 4.0.0",
        "evancz/elm-markdown": "2.0.0 <= v < 3.0.0",
        "evancz/elm-svg": "2.0.1 <= v < 3.0.0",
        "evancz/start-app": "2.0.2 <= v < 3.0.0"
    },
}
```

The easiest way to get this all set up is to remove everything from `dependencies` and just install the things you need one at a time with `elm-package install`.

> If you are updating a package that is publicly released on package.elm-lang.org, you probably to just move the upper bound on things. For example, if your project *never* uses record update, you can set `elm-version` to `0.15.0 <= v < 0.17.0` and have a bit of backwards compatibility.


## Updating Syntax

The major syntax changes are:


<table>
  <th>
    <td>feature</td>
    <td>0.15.1</td> 
    <td>0.16</td>
  </th>

  <tr>
    <td>field update</td>
    <td>
```elm
{ record | x <- 42 }
```
      </td>
    <td>
```elm
{ record | x = 42 }
```
      </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>field addition</td>
    <td>
```elm
{ record | x = 42 }
```
      </td>
    <td>removed</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>field deletion</td>
    <td>
```elm
{ record - x }
```
      </td>
    <td>removed</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>multi-way if</td>
    <td>
```elm
if | x < 0 -> "left"
   | x > 0 -> "right"
   | otherwise -> "neither"
```
    </td>
    <td>
```elm
if x < 0 then
    "left"

else if x > 0 then
    "right"

else
    "neither"
```
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
